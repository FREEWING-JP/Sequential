Sequential 2.0.1
Requires 10.3.9 or later.

Sequential is an image viewer for Mac OS X. It was originally designed for opening a folder of images and displaying them in order. It works well for viewing comics and manga.

Sequential can display folders and archives (ZIP, RAR, CBZ and CBR) of images (including JPEG, PNG, and GIF) and PDF files. It is able to load images on the internet from a page or image URL.

Sequential has mature full screen support and can display images' Exif data.

New in 2.0.1
- Animates changes to the current image scale.
- Fixes a bug that could cause some URLs to never finish loading.
- Fixes a bug that prevented the "round image corners" option from staying off.
- Fixes a bug where correct date or size information wouldn't show up in the Page menu.
- Better performance when deleting files or noticing folders update.
- Other minor improvements.
