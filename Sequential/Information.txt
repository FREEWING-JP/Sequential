Sequential 2
Requires 10.3.9 or later.

Sequential is an image viewer for Mac OS X. It was specifically designed for opening a folder of images and displaying them in order. It works well for viewing comics and manga.

Sequential can display folders and archives (ZIP, RAR, CBZ and CBR) of images (including JPEG, PNG, and GIF) and PDF files. It is able to load images on the internet from a page or image URL.

Sequential has mature full screen support and can display images' Exif data.

Email me at sequential@comcast.net. Feedback is especially welcome, as are localizations, icons, patches, etc. (Note: Email is the only way to know I've seen your comment. I'll reply, too.)

A list of keyboard shorcuts can be found under Help > Keyboard Shortcuts.
