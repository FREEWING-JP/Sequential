		<h1>Reading directions</h1>
		<p>You can change Sequential's reading direction to match the reading direction of the images you are viewing. Doing so makes Sequential start at the appropriate side of large images and affects the directions used to navigate between images.</p>
		<div class="howto">
			<h3>To change the reading direction:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Select the desired reading direction from the Sort menu.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>Western comics are almost always read from left to right. Manga can be read either from left to right (when they have been flipped), or from right to left (when they haven't).</p>
